# Sudoku Solver
Sudoku is a logic-based puzzle game that became popular in the late 20th century. The game consists of a 9x9 grid divided into nine 3x3 sub-grids called "boxes." The objective of Sudoku is to fill in the empty cells of the grid with numbers from 1 to 9, ensuring that each row, each column, and each box contains all the numbers from 1 to 9 without any repetition.

A standard Sudoku puzzle begins with some numbers already filled in, known as "givens" or "clues." These initial numbers serve as a starting point for the player. The challenge is to use logical reasoning and deduction to fill in the remaining empty cells while adhering to the rules of the game.

To solve a Sudoku puzzle, players must follow several rules:

1. Each row must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
2. Each column must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.
3. Each box must contain all the numbers from 1 to 9 without repetition.

As players fill in numbers, they need to ensure that no two identical numbers appear in the same row, column, or box. The difficulty of Sudoku puzzles varies, with some being relatively straightforward and others requiring advanced strategies and techniques.
